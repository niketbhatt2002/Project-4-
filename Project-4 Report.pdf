LLM Application with Azure Prompt Flow

1. Task Definition
Use Case: Customer Support Chatbot
- Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a customer support chatbot using Azure’s Prompt Flow. The chatbot answers customer queries with the help of Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4 model.
- Expected Outcomes:
    - Users can send queries and receive accurate, contextually relevant responses.
    - The system logs both input and output for monitoring.
    - The application is easily scalable with Azure infrastructure.

2. Prompt Flow Design
Flow Components:
- Input Nodes:
    - Captures user-provided text queries.
    - JSON-based input format (e.g., `{"input": "How can I reset my password?"}`).

- Model Nodes:
    - Uses Azure’s GPT-4 model to process the input.
    - Parameters: `temperature=0.7`, `max_tokens=500`.

- Output Nodes:
    - Structured JSON output.
    - Contains the LLM response, timestamp, and original query.

3. Prototype Summary
 Implementation Steps:
1. API Setup:
    - Created a Flask-based REST API to accept and process user queries.
    - Integrated Azure OpenAI API with the `openai` Python package.
2. Flow Execution:
    - User queries are passed to the GPT-4 model.
    - The model generates the response and returns it in JSON format.
3. Testing:
    - Tested with various queries to verify accuracy.
    - Added logging to monitor input and output.
 Challenges Faced:
- API Latency: Optimized prompt structure to reduce response time.
- Error Handling: Added proper exception handling for stable performance.

 4. Monitoring Insights
Metrics Tracked:
- Latency:
    - Average response time: ~1.2 seconds.
- Error Rates:
    - Error handling ensures fewer than 1% failures.
- User Feedback:
    - Positive results for common customer queries.

Logs:
- Input and output logs are saved for debugging and improvement.

 5. Future Improvements
- Prompt Optimization:
    - Improve prompt engineering for more contextually accurate responses.
- Caching:
    - Add caching mechanisms to reduce latency for frequently asked questions.
- Authentication:
    - Implement API key validation for security.
- UI Interface:
    - Develop a simple web interface for user interaction.



Conclusion: The project successfully developed an LLM application using Azure Prompt Flow. The chatbot handles customer queries efficiently, with monitoring in place for continuous improvements.
